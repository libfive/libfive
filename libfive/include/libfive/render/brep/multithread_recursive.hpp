// Calls Callable on Divisible, recursing over its children.  

// Divisible should be either a (possibly const) class or a pointer to one; in
// either case, the class should have a method getChildren(), returning an 
// iterable container of Divisibles with a size() method.

// If Out is not void, PreCallable should have the signature 
// Out(Divisible, Out* par, unsigned childNo, bool& recurse, Local&); 
// par will be the parent of the current node, or nullptr if the current node 
// is the root, and childNo will be which number child of that parent is
// currently being handled (or undefined if the current node is the root).  
// "recurse" must be set by PreCallable to instruct this algorithm whether to
// continue recursing or to make the current node into a leaf.  While 
// PreCallable may modify the Out that is passed in, it must do so atomically
// if at all.
// If Out is void, the signature should instead be
// void(Divisible, bool& recurse, Local&).  In either case, the call must be
// thread-safe with respect to any captured variables (i.e. only writing to 
// atomics, if at all), and its return value is also the return value of this
// function.

// PostCallable should have the signature void(Divisible, Out& child, Local&)
// if Out is not void, or void(Divisible, Local&) if it is.  PreCallable will be
// called before recursing to children, while PostCallable will be called
// afterward; there is no guarantee that the two will be called on the same 
// thread (or with the same Local&).  If "recurse" is set to false by 
// PreCallable, PostCallable will not be called.

// The final two function arguments (parent and childNo) should not be passed in
// except via recursive calling.
