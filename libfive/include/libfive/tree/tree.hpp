/*
 *  A Tree represents a tree of math expressions
 *
 *  It is a data object (passed around by value), which is a reference-counted
 *  wrapper around a TreeData pointer on the heap.  This is a homebrew shared
 *  pointer class, because we have very particular needs:
 *  - For the C API, we want to release pointers without decrementing the
 *    reference count, which prohibits shared_ptr.
 *  - When destroying deeply nested trees, we want to use the heap rather than
 *    the stack to prevent overflow, which prohibits boost::intrusive_ptr.
 *
 *  This means that we need a full-on rule-of-five class, with all of the
 *  excitement that brings along with it.
